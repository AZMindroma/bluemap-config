# BlueMap Config Files
Files for the BlueMap site (https://maps.azmindroma.de) of the MooseSMP (for any stranger fellow reading this, it's private, this repo is just public for the sake of the other server members finding it easily without needing to add all of them individually). 

Make sure to read https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/wiki/customization/Markers.html to see how to set markers up. Add your own marker, do a PR, and I can pull it right away and have it appear on the map.

I've also provided an example file from Season 1 which you may use as a reference!
